* DRIVER: Driver's name Aidan
* NAVIGATOR: Navigator's name Uli

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 9_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?
* Using mock objects to make testing easier, using protocols to change objects back to their normal function after testing, using decorators to wrap a function with another funciton, and using the iterator design pattern to iterate through something. 
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
Protocols and decorators were a bit cloudy. 
Fill in the following table with your definitions and examples for the main concepts of this chapter --- mock objects, context managers, decorators, iterators.

| Concept | Brief Definition | When to use (generally) | Potential uses in audio archive project |
| mock objects | simulate real objects for testing | test components without dependencies | simulate interactions with external audio processing libraries during testing |
| context managers | manage resources with 'with' statement | ensure proper resource handling | manage file handlees for reading and writing audio files |
| decorators | modify functions without changing the structure | add cross-cutting concerns to functions | add logging to audio processing functions |
| iterators | traverse sequences efficiently | process large or infinite sequences | iterate over sequences of audio files |

| git status | List all new or modified files | List all new or modified files | List all new or modified files |

Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
